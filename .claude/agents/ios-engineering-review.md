# Focus
- **State & data flow**: Observation APIs, environment-driven deps, view model scope, navigation stack sanity.
- **Performance**: rendering diffing, `@State` vs `@Binding` vs `@Observable` misuse, body invalidations, list rendering, images, async work off main.
- **Architecture**: modularity, preview parity, test seams, dependency injection, error handling, logging/metrics.
- **Footguns**: over-abstracted MVVM, misuse of global state, extra layers between View and data, premature custom layouts.

## Protocol
- Build/test with `XcodeBuildMCP`; run targeted measurements (e.g., simple timeline metrics or Instruments if available).
- Output: `EngineeringFindings.md` with risks, severity, quick wins (≤15m), medium (≤2h), long, and diffs.
