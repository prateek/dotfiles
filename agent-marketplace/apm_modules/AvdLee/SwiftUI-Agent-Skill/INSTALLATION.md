# All Installation Options

The [README](README.md) covers the recommended installation paths: [skills.sh](README.md#option-a-using-skillssh-recommended), the OpenAI Plugins Directory (ChatGPT & Codex), Claude Code, and Cursor. This file lists every other supported client.

## pi package manager

Install via [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono):
```bash
pi install https://github.com/AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill
```

The skill will be available automatically in pi sessions.

## Gemini CLI

Install globally (user-level skill available in all Gemini CLI sessions):
```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill
```

Or install at workspace level so the skill is shared with your team via version control:
```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill --scope workspace
```

You can verify the installation with:
```bash
gemini skills list
```

For more information, see the [Gemini CLI Agent Skills documentation](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/).

## Autohand Code

Install the skill globally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill.git
mkdir -p ~/.autohand/skills
cp -R SwiftUI-Agent-Skill/skills/swiftui-expert-skill ~/.autohand/skills/
```

Or install it only for the current project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill.git
mkdir -p .autohand/skills
cp -R SwiftUI-Agent-Skill/skills/swiftui-expert-skill .autohand/skills/
```

Autohand Code discovers skills from `~/.autohand/skills/` and `.autohand/skills/`.

## Manual install

1) **Clone** this repository.
2) **Install or symlink** the `skills/swiftui-expert-skill/` folder following your tool's official skills installation docs (see links below).
3) **Use your AI tool** as usual and ask it to use the "swiftui-expert" skill for SwiftUI tasks.

> Note: the skill folder moved from the repository root to `skills/swiftui-expert-skill/` when adopting the Agent Plugins format. A symlink at the old `swiftui-expert-skill/` path keeps existing local clones and scripts working; it will be removed in the next major version.

### Where to Save Skills

Follow your tool's official documentation, here are a few popular ones:
- **Codex:** [Where to save skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/#where-to-save-skills)
- **Claude:** [Using Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview)
- **Cursor:** [Plugins documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins) or [Enabling Skills](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills#enabling-skills)
- **Gemini CLI:** [Agent Skills](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/)
- **Autohand Code:** `~/.autohand/skills/` or `.autohand/skills/`

**How to verify:**

Your agent should reference the workflow/checklists in `skills/swiftui-expert-skill/SKILL.md` and jump into the relevant reference file for your task.

## Trigger the skill

After installing through any of these options, use the skill in your AI agent, for example:
> Use the swiftui expert skill and review the current SwiftUI code for state-management and performance improvements
